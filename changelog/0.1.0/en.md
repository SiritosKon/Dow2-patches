- ObsFix v1: observer lag fix, the "which slot am I in" lookup is cached for 500 ms.
- LobbyStats v0.7.0: Relic rating next to player names in the lobby and a tooltip with win rate, games and Steam hours;
  the host filter and auto-kick are gone.
- ReinforceFix v1: squads inside an Eldar webway gate keep auto-reinforce.
- CGNumbers v1: control-group numbers above squads, experimental skeleton (render path only).
- FrameProbe v9: diagnostics DLL (frame times, sim ticks, game thread stack sampler).
- winmm.dll loader: loads every DLL from `dow2-patches\` in vanilla and in Elite; each patch refuses to load twice.
